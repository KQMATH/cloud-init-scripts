#cloud-config

## FAQ ##
# Q: How do I use this file?
# A: 1. Install multipass (https://multipass.run/).
#    2. Replace the key in "ssh-authorized-keys" section with your own public ssh key
#    3. Uncomment the moodle plugins in section 3 you want to install
#    3. Open a cmd/powershell/... and run:
#       - multipass launch -vvv -n moodle --cloud-init <path to this cloud-init.yml file>
#    4. When the text "Waiting for initialization to complete..." appears,
#       just press Ctrl+C to get back to being able to run commands again.
#    5. Run the command:
#       - multipass shell moodle
#    6. By this time, the vm is still getting set up - it's downloading all the
#       packages and moodle files. You can execute the "htop" command
#       to get an overview of processes and cpu/memory usage. When you notice
#       the cpu usage drops to near 0%, you know it's finished and ready to use.
#
# Q: I see there are other cloud-init files too. What are they for?
# A: This configuration comes WITHOUT SSL/HTTPS. If you either don't own
#    a domain name, or you're host this vm on your local machine, you
#    won't be able to set up moodle with HTTPS. That means you HAVE
#    to use this file when you run "multipass launch ... --cloud-init <file>".
#    cloud-init-dns-challenge is for setting up SSL on your moodle
#    site using a DNS challenge, while http is for http challenge.

## TROUBLESHOOTING ##
# Problem:  After running multipass launch, it's stuck on
#           "Waiting for initialization to complete..."
# Solution: Just ignore this and press Ctrl+C to get back to being able
#           to write commands again. See point 4 in "Q: How do I use this file?"
#
# Problem:  After running multipass launch, it's stuck on "Starting moodle..."
# Solution: Run these commands:
#             - multipass delete moodle
#             - multipass purge
#             - multipass launch <same parameters as last time>
#
# Problem:  Executing multipass commands are generally slow/doesn't work
# Solution: Restart your PC, it's proven to help.
